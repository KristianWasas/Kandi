Here, since transposition table version can alter the search (in cases 3.2 and 3.1) , we will be conducting play with the three algorithms
against each other, we will be adding AB pruning, because AB pruning allows us to search deeper (faster), and has no impact on the result.
The games will be played from 3 opening positions, with both algorithms playing each side, so 6 games between two algorithms.
And we will only be looking at the result ie. draw, win or lose. How the result is achieved is discarded, since we only care of the 
preceived strenghts for now. The depth is static accross all the games
