1) only in a Maximizer node can update the corresponding alpha, so does Minimizer for beta.
2) value can only be returned up to its parent
3) alpha and beta can only be passed down from its parent
4) a-b passed down, value passed up
5) cutoffs happen if there has been found a better route to a leaf, either for minimizer or maximizer from a direct parent node (or grandpaernt, grandgrandparent, ...) 
6) a cutoff cant happen before the node has gotten some value ceiling/floor
